# Process

## 1. Understanding & Setup
By using the AI agent and reading the README.md file I can make an understanding of what is required and asked for.
In addition to this I also can take notes on important information about the client's business model and how it could be affectedin a positive way using a webpage.

## 2. Planning

I have installed next.js and git for the moment being since node was already in the environment.
If anything fails I could ask the AI agent if there are any problems that I could have missed, but either way im using the AI as a tool.

Moreover, I have also given the AI the current challenge as context so that any further implementations will follow what is being asked and avoid any derailings.

After giving the AI the required context, the steps will be.
    - Adding metadata to the layout.tsx (important for the search engines and embeded info)
    - Creating a homepage with the correct structure and SEO
    - Making the other pages and sections
    -   Implementing the Service Pages focusing on the most important aspects of the business model
    -   Implementing the about and contact sections

In all of theese steps there will be an use of a11n, optimizing images to webpg, implementing the sitemap.xml as requested, and of course a constant checkup that what is being implemented also follows the propoer cibersecurity measures in cases like textboxes.

## 3. Coding

In this section we are focusing on first making the "Blocks" components pages and their relation, since we got the AI we can make a preliminary version of theese in order to already have a fallback. eitherway
